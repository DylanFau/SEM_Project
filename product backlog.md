#  Product Backlog

This backlog outlines the required features for the Population Reporting System. Each item is written as a user story, prioritized, and includes acceptance criteria.


  High Priority (Must Have)

 US01 - List all countries by population
As a user,  
I want to see a list of all countries ordered by population (largest to smallest),  
So that I can understand global population distribution.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Countries are displayed in descending population order.
- Each entry includes: Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population, Capital.


 US02 - List countries in a continent by population
As a user,  
I want to see all countries in a selected continent ordered by population,  
So that I can analyze regional population trends.

Acceptance Criteria:
- User selects a continent.
- Countries in that continent are listed from most to least populated.
- Required columns: Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population, Capital.


 US03 - Get top N most populated countries
As a user,  
I want to specify the number N and get the top N most populated countries,  
So that I can focus on the largest countries by population.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Input field accepts an integer N.
- Displays top N countries by population in descending order.

US04 - View all cities by population
As a user,  
I want to see a list of all cities ordered by population,  
So that I can analyze urban population concentrations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- List includes: City Name, Country, District, Population.
- Ordered by population (largest to smallest).


US05 - Get population breakdown by continent
As a user,  
I want to see population breakdowns per continent,  
So that I can analyze urban vs rural population trends.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Each continent displays:
  - Total population
  - Population living in cities (+ %)
  - Population not living in cities (+ %)

 US06 - Get population breakdown by region
As a user,  
I want to see population breakdowns per region,  
So that I can do more localized planning.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Same as above, but at the region level.


 US07 - Report on number of language speakers
As an executive,  
I want to see how many people speak Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, and Arabic,  
So that I can plan for language-specific policies.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Shows total number of speakers per language.
- Shows % of world population.
- Ordered from most to least spoken.


  Medium Priority (Should Have)
US08 - List cities in a country by population
As a user,  
I want to list cities within a country by population,  
So that I can understand urban distribution within a country.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Country is selected via input or dropdown.
- Cities listed from largest to smallest.
- Columns: City Name, District, Population.

 US09 - View all capital cities ordered by population
As a user,  
I want to see all capital cities by population,  
So that I can analyze capital city populations globally.

Acceptance Criteria:
- List includes: Name, Country, Population.
- Ordered by descending population.


 Low Priority (Could Have)
 US10 - Population of a specific district
As a user,  
I want to get the total population of a district,  
So that I can evaluate small-scale populations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- User inputs district name.
- Returns population total.

 Wonâ€™t Have (Not in scope for MVP)
- Mobile version of the application.
- Real-time updates or data syncing.
- User authentication or login system.

  Notes for Sprint Planning
- Prioritize US01 through US05 for Sprint 1 & 2.
- Save Medium/Low priority items for Sprint 3+.
- Break larger stories (e.g. "population by region") into smaller subtasks in GitHub issues.
